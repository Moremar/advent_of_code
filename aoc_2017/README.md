# Advent of Code 2017

This project contains my solutions for the 2017 Advent of Code puzzles.  
It is implemented in Java, using Gradle as a build system.

It can be built and run without any local Gradle installation by using the Gradle wrapper included in this project.  
The full set of solvers runs in less than 10 seconds.
```shell
./gradlew run
```

All tests in the project can be run with :
```shell
./gradlew test
```
